# Options-Pricing


> 10-Dec-2017
The idea of this project is to compare binomial methods and Monte Carlo methods for pricing different types of financial options.


## Volatility estimate
The volatility input comes from two sources:
* Historical volatility
* Implied volatility

## Types of options
We use a combination of
* European & American
* Vanilla & Binary

## Next steps
The comparison is obviously not complete without a path-dependent option. Asian options might be added if time allows.
